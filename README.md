# Face-Recongnition
**********************readme************************
For the midterm project, I implemented four mothods.
For eigenface, I buil two models with/without highest 3 PC. 
For fisherface and SVM, I attached a .py file seperately.
For SRC, I attached a file holder for the MATLAB code.

To run the python code, you need to install few librarys, including numpy, openCV, sk_learn.
To run the MATLAB code, you need to install CVX.
